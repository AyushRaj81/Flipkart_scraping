# Flipkart_scraping
 In this project, i have done web scraping for Flipkart data where we scrap data of mobile phones using Python and various libraries such as requests, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas.
 
 The first step in this project was to identify the specific Flipkart page to scrape. In this case, we were interested in the mobile phones store page. Once the page was identified, we used the requests library to download the page's HTML content. The requests library is a Python library that allows us to send HTTP requests using Python. We then used Beautiful Soup to parse and extract the relevant information from the downloaded HTML content.
 
 Beautiful Soup is a Python library used to parse HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data in a hierarchical and more readable manner. In this project, we used Beautiful Soup to extract the name of the mobile phone, its price, original price, number of reviews, features, and a link to buy.
 
 The next step was to convert the extracted data into a structured format that could be easily analyzed and manipulated. I used Pandas, a Python library for data manipulation and analysis, to convert the data into a Pandas dataframe. The Pandas dataframe is a two-dimensional size-mutable, tabular data structure with labeled axes. It consists of rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type (e.g., string, integer, float).
 
 Once the data was converted to a Pandas dataframe, we created a CSV file for each phone containing the extracted information in the specified format. CSV stands for Comma Separated Values and is a common format used for data storage and exchange. In our case, I used it to store the data extracted from the Flipkart website.
 
 The project involved a few key steps, including identifying the specific Flipkart page to scrape, downloading the page's HTML content using requests, parsing and extracting relevant information using Beautiful Soup, converting the data into a Pandas dataframe, and exporting the data to CSV format. Each step required careful attention to detail, as any mistakes or oversights could impact the accuracy and completeness of the final data.
